# How to use Sample Snack app

Open the `App.js` file to start writing some code. You can preview the changes directly on your phone or tablet by clicking the **Run** button or use the simulator by clicking **Tap to Play**. When you're done, click **Save** and share the link!

When you're ready to see everything that Expo provides (or if you want to use your own editor) you can **Export** your project and use it with [expo-cli](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/installation.html).

All projects created in Snack are publicly available, so you can easily share the link to this project via link, or embed it on a web page with the **Embed** button.

If you're having problems, you can tweet to us [@expo](https://twitter.com/expo) or ask in our [forums](https://forums.expo.io).

Snack is Open Source. You can find the code on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/expo/snack-web).
